Earning Coins

Coins are given out based on good driving and rule following. A constant coin rate will be given while driving, which can be lowered or halted if rules are broken, but maybe increased if you have consistent rule following or good driving.


How check if good driving

Phone will be tracking current location, and algorithms will check for multiple things. Opening your phone while not stopped is a negative. Going over or too low according to the speed limit is negative. Not waiting a proper time at a stop sign and going during a red light is a negative.


Analysis and tips section

Will offer analysis based on previous rides. Could say things like: you average 5 seconds at a stop sign, we recommend waiting longer. etc.


Currency itself
